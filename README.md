# 📋 List Selection Program in C#

Welcome to the **List Selection** program — a simple and interactive console application written in C# that allows users to manage a list of integers through a menu-driven interface.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly C# application that demonstrates the use of:

- Lists and loops
- Switch-case statements
- Manual implementations of common operations like sorting, searching, and averaging

> ⚠️ Built-in LINQ methods such as `.Sort()`, `.Min()`, `.Max()`, `.Avg()`, and `.Find()` are **not used** — all logic is implemented manually.

---

## 🎯 Features

- `P` - **Print numbers** in the list
- `A` - **Add a number** (prevents duplicates)
- `M` - **Calculate mean** of the list
- `S` - **Find smallest** number
- `L` - **Find largest** number
- `F` - **Find a number** by value and display its index
- `C` - **Clear the list**
- `T` - **Toggle sort order** (Ascending / Descending)
- `D` - **Display current sort order**
- `Q` - **Quit** the application

## 🚀 How to Run

### Run via .NET CLI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mostafa-SAID7/list-selection.git
cd list-selection
dotnet run
```
You can also run it from Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code by opening the folder and pressing F5 or using the terminal.

### 💡 Learning Goals
This project helps you:

. ✅ Practice list manipulation in C#
. ✅ Implement manual sorting (bubble sort logic)
. ✅ Handle user input using switch-case statements
. ✅ Think algorithmically about calculating mean, minimum, and maximum without built-ins

### 🧩 Potential Add-ons
Consider adding the following to enhance the project:

. 🔁 Swap two elements by index
. ↩️ Undo the last action (add or remove)
. 💾 Save/load list from a file
. 🖼️ Create a GUI version using WinForms or WPF
. 📤 Export the list to a .csv or .json file

### 🛠 Requirements

. .NET 6.0 SDK or later
. An IDE or editor such as:
. Visual Studio
. Visual Studio Code (with the C# extension)
. Or a simple terminal for running with dotnet run
